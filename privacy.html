        <p>Thank you for using AI Visionary Studio ("App", "we", "us"). This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, how it is shared, and the choices you have. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>1) What We Do</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>AI Visionary Studio helps you generate short films, scenes, and related media from text prompts and optional images.</li>
          <li>The App communicates with our backend service at <code>visionary.santax.xyz</code> to process requests and deliver results.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2) Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>Account identifiers</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Anonymous Firebase Authentication UID (no email/phone required) to associate your requests, history, and credits.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Usage and content</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Prompts, settings (e.g., scene count, toggles), and optional uploaded images you provide for generation.</li>
          <li>Generated outputs (images, scene data, videos) and basic logs necessary to render results and show your History.</li>
          <li>In‑app purchase metadata (product identifiers, transaction IDs) needed to provision credits and fight fraud.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Device and permissions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Photos access: only if you choose to save generated images/videos to your device or upload a photo for character replacement. The App does not read your library beyond what you select.</li>
          <li>Notifications: if enabled, we may send local notifications to inform you when processing completes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Diagnostic data</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Basic performance and error logs (e.g., response sizes, parse status) to keep the service reliable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3) How We Use Information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide and improve the App (process prompts, generate media, show history, manage credits).</li>
          <li>Secure the service (authenticate users, verify purchases, prevent abuse or fraud).</li>
          <li>Communicate with you about service features and completion status (e.g., local notifications).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4) Where Content Is Processed and Stored</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Backend processing occurs on cloud infrastructure and integrated automation pipelines. Some generated assets (e.g., videos) may be served from public, unindexed URLs on <code>visionary.santax.xyz</code>. Anyone with the exact link can view the file. Avoid including personal data in prompts or uploaded images.</li>
          <li>User history and credit balances are stored in Firebase (Firestore) keyed by your anonymous UID.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5) Sharing of Information</h2>
        <h3>Service providers</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Firebase (Authentication, Firestore) for anonymous sign‑in and storage.</li>
          <li>Adapty for in‑app purchases and subscription profile management.</li>
          <li>Apple (StoreKit) for payment processing.</li>
          <li>Video processing and workflow orchestration providers as part of our pipeline (e.g., FFmpeg, automation services). We limit sharing to what’s necessary to operate the App.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Legal and safety</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We may disclose information to comply with laws, enforce our Terms, or protect rights, safety, and property.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout">We do not sell personal information.</div>

        <h2>6) Data Retention</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>History entries and generated assets may be retained to provide your in‑app History and for service reliability. We periodically prune old items where feasible.</li>
          <li>Transaction and accounting records are retained as required by law.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7) Your Choices and Rights</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Access and deletion: You can request deletion of your history and UID‑linked data by contacting us (see Contact). Because accounts are anonymous, we may ask you to confirm your Profile ID shown in the App to verify ownership.</li>
          <li>Photos and notifications: You can change permission settings at any time in iOS Settings.</li>
          <li>Opt‑out of analytics/tracking: The App does not use third‑party advertising SDKs. If tracking permission is requested by the OS, it is used only to improve personalization and analytics within legal limits.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8) Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not directed to children under 13 (or minimum age required in your jurisdiction). If you believe we have collected personal data from a child, contact us to delete it.</p>

        <h2>9) Security</h2>
        <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect data in transit and at rest. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>10) International Transfers</h2>
        <p>We may process and store information on servers located outside your country. By using the App, you consent to the transfer of information to countries that may have different data protection rules.</p>

        <h2>11) Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy to reflect changes to our practices or for legal reasons. If changes are material, we will notify you in‑app or by updating the effective date.</p>

        <h2>12) Contact</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>For privacy requests or questions, contact: <a href="mailto:support@visionary.app">vireyalabs@gmail.com</a></li>
          <li>When requesting data access or deletion, include your in‑app Profile ID (UID) to help us locate your data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>13) Jurisdiction‑Specific Disclosures</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>EU/EEA and UK residents: Where applicable, you may have rights to access, rectify, erase, restrict, port, or object to processing. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your supervisory authority.</li>
          <li>California residents: We do not sell personal information. You may request access or deletion consistent with the CCPA/CPRA definitions and limits.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>This policy is tailored to the current App behavior: anonymous sign‑in (UID), prompt/image processing, history storage, local notifications, photo library access, and in‑app purchases via Apple/Adapty. If your deployment or providers change, update this document accordingly.</p>
