        <p>Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms") carefully before using AI Visionary Studio ("App", "we", "us"). By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

        <h2>1) Overview</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>AI Visionary Studio enables users to generate scenes and videos from text prompts and optional images via cloud processing. The App is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2) Eligibility and Account</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Anonymous Sign‑In:</strong> The App uses anonymous authentication to associate your activity (e.g., credits and history) with a unique identifier. You are responsible for keeping your device secure.</li>
          <li><strong>Age:</strong> You must be of legal age in your jurisdiction to use the App. If you are under the minimum age, you may not use the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3) Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree not to use the App to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Violate any law or third‑party rights (including privacy, publicity, and intellectual property rights).</li>
          <li>Generate, upload, or share content that is illegal, harmful, harassing, hateful, exploitative, or sexually explicit.</li>
          <li>Upload personal or sensitive images without consent.</li>
          <li>Attempt to access, interfere with, or disrupt any service or system.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout">We may suspend or terminate access for violations.</div>

        <h2>4) Your Content and License</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You may provide prompts, settings, and optional images ("User Content"). You retain ownership of your User Content.</li>
          <li><strong>License to Us:</strong> You grant us a worldwide, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free license to host, reproduce, process, and display your User Content and generated outputs solely to operate and improve the App (including storage and delivery through public, unindexed URLs where necessary).</li>
          <li><strong>Public URLs:</strong> Some generated assets (e.g., videos) may be served from public, unindexed links. Anyone with the exact link can view them. Do not include personal data you do not want disclosed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5) Generated Outputs</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ownership:</strong> Subject to third‑party model or provider terms, we assign to you our rights, if any, in the outputs we generate specifically for you, solely to the extent permitted by law and applicable provider terms. You are responsible for how you use outputs.</li>
          <li><strong>No Guarantees:</strong> AI outputs may be inaccurate, unexpected, or infringing. You must review and use them responsibly at your own risk.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6) Credits, Purchases, and Billing</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Credits:</strong> The App uses credits to access generation features. Pricing and unit consumption are described in‑app and may change.</li>
          <li><strong>Purchases:</strong> Payments are processed via Apple (StoreKit) and managed via Adapty. Taxes may apply.</li>
          <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> All sales are final except where required by law. Apple’s App Store refund policies may apply.</li>
          <li><strong>Fraud:</strong> We may withhold, reverse, or adjust credits in cases of suspected fraud or abuse.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7) Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The App, including its software, UI, and content (excluding your User Content), is owned by us or our licensors and is protected by law. You receive a limited, non‑transferable, revocable license to use the App for personal, non‑commercial purposes.</p>

        <h2>8) Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our collection and use of information is described in the Privacy Policy. By using the App, you consent to the processing of your information consistent with that policy.</p>

        <h2>9) Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>THE APP AND ALL OUTPUTS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ACCURACY, NON‑INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. WE DO NOT WARRANT UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR‑FREE OPERATION.</p>

        <h2>10) Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR REPUTATION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THE APP SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US IN THE 3 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM OR USD $50, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.</p>

        <h2>11) Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You will defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless from any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your use of the App, your User Content, or your violation of these Terms or any law or third‑party rights.</p>

        <h2>12) Changes, Suspension, and Termination</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>We may modify the App or these Terms at any time. If changes are material, we will provide reasonable notice in‑app or by updating the effective date. Your continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</li>
          <li>We may suspend or terminate access at any time, including for violations or service abuse.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>13) Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of your place of residence unless otherwise required by applicable law. Venue and jurisdiction will be as permitted by law. Where arbitration or mandatory consumer rights apply, those rights remain unaffected.</p>
